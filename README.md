# authentication

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my **Authentication Project with Express.js**â€”This project I have created to enhanced my backend development skills using the Express.js framework.

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable hands-on experience in setting up an Express.js application, managing user data with Sequelize, ensuring password security via hashing, crafting user registration and login routes, and incorporating basic access control.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

1. **User Sign-Up:** Users can easily register new accounts by providing their name, email, and password.

2. **User Sign-In:** Registered users have the ability to log into the application using their email and password.

3. **Password Hashing:** To ensure maximum security, passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt library before storage.

4. **Validation:** I've meticulously implemented validation logic to ensure user input meets necessary criteria, ensuring data integrity.

5. **Database Interaction:** User data is seamlessly managed through an SQLite database using Sequelize as my chosen ORM tool.
